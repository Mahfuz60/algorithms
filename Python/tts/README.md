* [eSpeak](https://espeak.sourceforge.net/) ([mp3](mark-twain-pyttsx3.mp3)): Horrible. I can barely understand what is said. I don't even want to try languages other than English.
* [gTTs](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) ([mp3](mark-twain-gtts.mp3)): Not exactly awesome, but one can understand it. However, this is NOT local!
