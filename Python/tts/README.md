Exploring speach synthesis / text-to-speach (TTS).

## Options

* [eSpeak](https://espeak.sourceforge.net/) ([Mark Twain Example](mark-twain-pyttsx3.mp3)): Horrible. I can barely understand what is said. I don't even want to try languages other than English.
* [gTTs](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/) ([Mark Twain Example](mark-twain-gtts.mp3)): Not exactly awesome, but one can understand it. It's free, but not locally generated.
* [Lyrebird by descript](https://www.descript.com/lyrebird) is amazing. Sadly, it's not free and not locally generated.
